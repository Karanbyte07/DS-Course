# DATA SCIENCE COURSE — Python for Data Science 

Welcome! This repository is a hands-on, notebook-first learning path for anyone starting Python for Data Science. It contains interactive Jupyter Notebooks that walk you step-by-step through core Python concepts with explanations, runnable examples, and exercises so you can practice as you learn.

Repository goals
- Provide a clear, incremental learning path for Python fundamentals used in data science.
- Offer runnable examples and short exercises so learners get hands-on experience.
- Serve as a living learning resource that will grow to include practical projects and common data science libraries.

What’s in this repo
- A series of numbered Jupyter Notebooks covering foundational Python topics (variables, control flow, data structures, functions, OOP, file handling, JSON, comprehensions, lambdas, etc.).
- The repository will expand over time to include end-to-end mini-projects and notebooks demonstrating popular libraries and tools used by data scientists (for example: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn and others).

Who this is for
- Beginners who want to learn Python with practical, example-driven notebooks.
- Students preparing for data science coursework who need to strengthen core Python skills.
- Early-career data scientists who prefer learning by reading code and running interactive examples.

How to use this repo (quick start)
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Karanbyte07/DS-Course.git
2. Install a minimal environment (Python 3.8+ recommended; Python 3.10+ to run structural pattern matching examples):
   - Option A (JupyterLab):
     pip install jupyterlab
     jupyter lab
   - Option B (classic Notebook):
     pip install notebook
     jupyter notebook
   - Option C (Google Colab):
     - Open individual notebooks via Colab's GitHub integration.
3. Open the notebooks in order and run the cells. Try the exercises and modify code to deepen your understanding.

Recommended environment and tools
- Python 3.8+ (3.10+ recommended for some examples)
- JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code (with Python and Jupyter extensions)
- Google Colab (if you prefer a cloud environment)

Learning tips
- Run the notebooks cell-by-cell and type variations of the examples yourself.
- Tweak exercises and try edge cases to understand behavior.
- Recreate small tasks from memory after reading a notebook — then compare with the notebook to learn faster.
- Combine concepts from different notebooks (for example, file handling + JSON + basic data processing) to create mini projects.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Open an issue to propose larger changes or submit a clear PR for fixes and improvements. If adding notebooks that require extra packages, note required packages/versions in the notebook header.
